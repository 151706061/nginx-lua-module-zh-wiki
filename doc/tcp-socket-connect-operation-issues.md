TCP socket connect operation issues
-----------------------------------
The [tcpsock:connect](#tcpsockconnect) method may indicate `success` despite connection failures such as with `Connection Refused` errors. 

However, later attempts to manipulate the cosocket object will fail and return the actual error status message generated by the failed connect operation. 

This issue is due to limitations in the Nginx event model and only appears to affect Mac OS X.
