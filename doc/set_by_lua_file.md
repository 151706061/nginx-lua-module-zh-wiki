set_by_lua_file
---------------
**syntax:** *set_by_lua_file $res &lt;path-to-lua-script-file&gt; [$arg1 $arg2 ...]*

**context:** *server, server if, location, location if*

**phase:** *rewrite*

Equivalent to [set_by_lua](#set_by_lua), except that the file specified by `<path-to-lua-script-file>` contains the Lua code, or, as from the `v0.5.0rc32` release, the [Lua/LuaJIT bytecode](#lualuajit-bytecode-support) to be executed. 

Nginx variable interpolation is supported in the `<path-to-lua-script-file>` argument string of this directive. But special care must be taken for injection attacks.

When a relative path like `foo/bar.lua` is given, they will be turned into the absolute path relative to the `server prefix` path determined by the `-p PATH` command-line option while starting the Nginx server.

When the Lua code cache is turned on (by default), the user code is loaded once at the first request and cached 
and the Nginx config must be reloaded each time the Lua source file is modified.
The Lua code cache can be temporarily disabled during development by 
switching [lua_code_cache](#lua_code_cache) `off` in `nginx.conf` to avoid reloading Nginx.

This directive requires the [ngx_devel_kit](https://github.com/simpl/ngx_devel_kit) module.
